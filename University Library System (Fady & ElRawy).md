new registration, with a simplified searching for finding the user aim.

## Problems :
- The only problem face the programmers is searching function, how to contact the search function
with the arrays and the algorithms for finding.
- The GUI problem is more complicated because of two reasons they are the time isn’t enough and
communicate the data programme with display of information.
